# Underworld
A 2D dungeon crawler game where the player picks up keys, opens doors, disables traps, and avoid enemies to reach the end of the level
Note: The timer currently does not work and there is a bug where, after playing multiple times in the same session, the game becomes
extremly slow and laggy.
